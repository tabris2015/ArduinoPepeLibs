# ArduinoPepeLibs
Useful libraries for several sensors, modules and devices for using with arduino. 
## Elemental
This library includes a class for controling dc motors through a H-bridge or driver. It supports
several modules or chipas such as l298n, l293d and others where each motor needs 3 pins for control of 
direction and speed with PWM.
